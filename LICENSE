                        LICENSING INFORMATION

Ilmendur is distributed under the licensing terms outlined below. In
short: the source code is licensed under the GPLv3, the support media
and anything else are licensed as CC-BY-SA 4.0. If you intend to
distribute the entire game in binary form as a whole containing both
assets and object code, please pay special attention to the
compatibility clause in the CC-BY-SA license, which makes this
possible.

Any programming libraries Ilmendur depends on are not shipped with the
game. Obtain them elsewhere and use them in accordance with each
dependency's respective license. Thus, there is no licensing
information for these dependencies to be found in this file.
