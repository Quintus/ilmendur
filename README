                           < Role-Play Game >

This is a personal project of my friends and me to develop a role-play
game.

                             How to build
                             ------------

The project is written in C++ with Ogre as the 3D game engine and GLFW
as the window management system. Most of its dependency libraries are
compiled during the project compilation and then linked in statically.
Exempted from this rule are only system-specific libraries such as
libx11, which are searched for and linked in dynamically. The build
system used is CMake.

Therefore, to successfully build this project you need:

- A working C++ compiler, which needs to be capable of C++11.
- CMake, at least version 3.13.
- The build tools used by the dependencies that are compiled:
  * pkg-config
  * Autotools
- A Unix system (Windows is not yet supported).
- The following Unix-specific libraries and their development
  headers:
  * The X11 libraries: libx11, libxrandr, libsm, libice, libxext,
    libxrender, libxcb, libxau, libxdmcp
  * The OpenGL libraries, in the newer GLVND variant (libOpenGL
    and libGLX).
  * pthreads and dl (you have this if your system uses GNU libc (glibc),
    which is the case for most Linux distrbutions).

On Ubuntu 20.04, all required dependencies can be installed with the
following command at once:

    $ sudo apt install build-essential g++ cmake libx11-dev \
      libglvnd-dev libxrandr-dev libice-dev libxext-dev \
      libsm-dev libxrender-dev libxau-dev libxdmcp-dev \
      libicu-dev zlib1g-dev automake libxinerama-dev \
      libxcursor-dev libxi-dev pkg-config

Any other dependencies are automatically compiled during the
compilation of the project. This can take quite a while, but you only
need to do it once, unless the dependencies change later on. In that
case, cmake will pick this up and build the new dependencies as
needed. If you are interested in the exact list of dependencies
compiled in this process, consult deps/CMakeLists.txt.

To build this project, execute the following commands:

    $ cd /path/to/this/repository
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    $ make

You can (and should) pass the option -jN to the call to make(1), where
`N' should be replaced with the number of CPU cores you have. This
massively speeds up the build as files can be compiled in parallel.
E.g., use `make -j4' on a system with four CPU cores.

Note: It is neither useful nor possible to call `make install' at this
point. There is no installation target available currently.

To run the created programme, execute:

    $ ./rpg
