* Local and global transformation space

- All scene nodes have a local transformation space and a global
  transformation space.
- The local space is relative to whatever orientation the scene node
  currently has. This makes it easy to say things like “move forward”,
  whatever direction “forward” may be in global terms.
- All models face down the X axis as per instructions for the artists.
  Hence, “move forward” is equal to increasing X in the local space
  for nodes connected to models.
- Ogre cameras face up (!) the Z axis. Hence, “move forward” for an
  Ogre camera means decreasing the Z coordinate in local space.

* Reference point for quaternions

- Ogre quaternions rotate relative the natural direction, not the
  current orientation. They are absolute values.
- The natural direction for models is, as per instructions for the
  artists, Ogre::Vector3::UNIT_X, i.e. positive X axis.
- The natural direction for Ogre cameras is always
  -Ogre::Vector3::UNIT_Z, i.e. negative Z axis.
