* Overview

INI files accompany each graphic file that is meant to be used in the construction of actors. The INI file format divides a plain-text file into sections denoted by brackets, followed by key-value pairs. Currently, Ilmendur only supports a single section called =[object]=. Its valid key/value pairs are described below.

* =[object]= section

| Key        | Allowed values | Meaning                                    | Default value  |
|------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------+----------------|
| origx      | integers >= 0  | X origin of the first frame                | stridex/2      |
| origy      | integers >= 0  | Y origin of the first frame                | stridey/2      |
| stridex    | integers >= 0  | Width of first frame                       | (image width)  |
| stridey    | integers >= 0  | Height of first frame                      | (image height) |
| animated   | integers >= 0  | Milliseconds a single frame is shown.      | 0              |

| collw      | integers >= 0  | Collision box width                        | stridex        |
| collh      | integers >= 0  | Collision box height                       | stridey        |
